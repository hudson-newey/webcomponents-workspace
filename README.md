# Web Components Workspace

## Workspace Configuration

We recommend using the `webcomponents.code-workspace` in VSCode & running `package.json` scripts through the "NPM Scripts" view.

## How to use

### Development Environment

- Run the "storybook" launch option from the VSCode debugger (_recommend_)
- Run the "storybook" script from the vscode npm scripts
- Run `pnpm dev` from a terminal window
