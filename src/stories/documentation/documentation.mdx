# What I had to do to get this working

- The render field in the stories has to refer to a storybook component.
  We therefore return the Lit component from storybook html string.
- I had to enable `expiermentalDecorators` and disable `useDefineForClassFields`
  in the `tsconfig.json` file.
- I had to create a `stories.ts` file for each storybook component.
  - In this file, I had to export a `Meta` object as `default`.
  - For each `story.ts` I outlined stories which modified the props
    object passed to the storybook props attributes.
- Components under `src/components` must have jsdoc comments for vite to
  identify slots and css parts.

## Tech stack

- Storybook for documentation and testing
- Vite for build
- Lit for web components
- Typescript for type safety
- Jest for testing
- Playwright as a browser test runner

## Running Tests

We use two testing frameworks: Jest and Playwright.

We use jest for interaction and unit testing, and playwright for browser testing.
