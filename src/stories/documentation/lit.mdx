## Common Gotchas

- Events such as `@click="${myFunction}"` will be called whenever they are rendered.
    To make it so that they are only invoked when the event is called, we need to do a
    react like callback eg. `@click="${() => myFunction()}"`
    - Alternatively you can do something like `@click="${myFunction}"` if it has the same
    return type that the event attribute expects.
