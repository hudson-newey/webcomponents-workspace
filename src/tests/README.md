# Tests

## Unit tests

Test the functionality of components in isolation, ideally just one component at a time

## Interaction tests

Is a story

When a user event occurs, does the correct effect happen

Interaction tests should only be used for the basis of our documentation and to show a component in different states after user interaction

## End-to-end

Are additional tests that import a story as a fixture

When I combine multiple components together, does communication and interacts correctly

eg. When I have an axis and spectrogram component does the axis render
the correct scale when I upload a file
