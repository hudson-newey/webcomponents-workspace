# Tests

## Unit tests

Test the functionality of components without interaction

eg. When the todo list is empty, does it show the correct text

## Interaction tests

When a user event occurs, does the correct effect happen

eg. When I add or complete a todo list item does the correct thing happen and
Is the correct text rendered to the DOM

## End-to-end

When I combine multiple components together, does communication occur correctly

eg. When I have an axis and spectrogram component does the axis render
the correct scale when I upload a file
